It is mandated by regulations to facilitate \nyour comprehension of the fund’s characteristics and associated risks. We strongly recommend reviewing it to enable an informed investment \ndecision.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe investment objective of the Arvocap Africa Equity Special \nFund (ZAR) is to achieve risk-adjusted returns surpassing the \nmarket average by investing in high-value, highly liquid stocks \ntracked by the S&P Africa 40 index. It aims to accumulate capital \nthrough a mid-to-long-term perspective on equities offering \nhigh returns and strategic positioning.\nINVESTMENT POLICY\nThe fund’s investment strategy entails actively managing \nasset allocation within an equity portfolio of high-quality \nAfrica businesses listed in various exchanges across Africa. \nThe nature of the underlying business for a company to \nqualify, even when its cross-listed or listed outside Africa \nis that a huge portion of its revenue is derived in Africa. A \nkey consideration for the portfolio assets is the shape of \ntheir balance sheets, with the fund allocating capital only \nto businesses that maintain strong balance sheets. Utilizing \ncash and cash equivalents as a control tool between trades, \nthe fund ensures effective portfolio management.\nWHY THE FUND IS CATEGORY 6?\nThe fund is rated category 6 due to its exposure to equities/\nshares and the inherit nature of equities prices characteristics \nand their risks as outlined below. The factors below have an \nimpact on the value of investments and expose the fund to \npotential losses.  \nThe price of shares and any income derived from them \nsuch as dividends may rise and fall and the investors when \nliquidating may not get back an equal amount to what they \nhave invested. \nIt may be difficult for a fund to liquidate an redeem its \nunderlying assets in a short notice during extreme market \nconditions without suffering a loss.  \nThe fund invests in different global markets and the global \ncurrency fluctuations may have an impact on the fund.  \nRestrictions are placed on the aggregate book value of \ninvestments in a single company and holdings related \nto any single issuer, maintaining prudent diversification \nand risk management practices. Compliance with these \nlimits and restrictions is monitored based on the most up-\nto-date value of the Arvocap Africa Equity Fund, with a \n5% allowance permitted for breaches through portfolio \nappreciation. Monthly reports in the form of fact sheets are \nprovided to Unit Holders, offering comprehensive insights \ninto investment activity, performance, and any changes \nwithin the portfolio.\nAdditionally, all units in the fund offer an income \naccumulation option, allowing income generated from \nunderlying investments to accrue to unit holders in the form \nof new units. The fund benchmarks its performance against \nthe S&P Africa 40 Index, aligning its investment objectives \nwith the broader African equity market performance.\nInvesting may lead to payment of additional fees and \nexpenses in relation to the fund executing it trades. \nWHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN\nThe numbers rate how the fund will behave and how much \nrisk there is to your invested capital. Generally, in markets \nthe chance to make large gains means a risk of suffering \nhigher losses. \nRisk category 1:\nA category 1 fund is not a risk-free investment. It means the \nrisk of losing your invested capital is small, but also the risk \nof making gains is small.  \nRisk category 7:\nIn a category 7 fund, the potential for huge returns is high \nbut also the risk of losing your money is also high. \nNote: The seven-category risk scale (The Synthetic Risk and \nReward Indicator, SRRI, series) is a complex undertaking \nand a scale category of 2 does not imply that it is twice as \nrisky as category 1 risk. \t\nAdditional risks to the fund have been outlined in the \nsupplementary information memorandum of the fund \nin addition to the risks outlined in the Arvocap Unit Trust \nScheme Information Memorandum.\nLower Risk\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nTypically lower rewards\nHigher Risk\nTypically higher rewards\nManaged by Arvocap Asset Managers Limited\nKEY INVESTOR\nINFORMATION DOCUMENT\nArvocap Africa Equity Special Fund\nRegulated by The Capital Markets Authority\nT: +254 701 300 200  /  E: invest@arvocap.com  //  www.arvocap.com",

It is mandated by regulations to facilitate \nyour comprehension of the fund’s characteristics and associated risks. We strongly recommend reviewing it to enable an informed investment \ndecision.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe investment objective of the Arvocap Eurofix Special Fund is \nto generate significant dollar income by investing in high-quality \nsovereign bonds, corporate bonds, and structured products, \nwhile also achieving long-term absolute capital growth.\nINVESTMENT POLICY\nThe Arvocap Eurofix Fixed Income Special Fund (USD) \nadheres to a carefully crafted investment strategy focusing \non Fixed Income products in the global market. The fund \naims at delivering high regular dollar incomes to its investors, \nwhile also giving them a potential to generate capital growth \nthrough an active investment strategy employed by the \nfund. The fund also seeks to deploy active capital to fund \nglobal companies that are the engine for the world economy \nto meet their capital requirements through investments in \ncorporate bonds and structured products.\nWHY THE FUND IS CATEGORY 4?\nThe fund is rated category 4 due to its exposure to volatile \nfixed income products and the risks they possess outlined \nbelow. The factors below have an impact on the value of \ninvestments and expose the fund to potential losses.  \nThe income derived from the underlying asset may fall when \nthere is late payments or defaults by the issuer. \nThe price of the underlying asset may rise or fall under the \nimpact or yields, or demand and supply dynamics leading \nto variance and potential capital loss during normal trading \nor liquidation.  Changes in an issuers risk categorization by \nrating agencies can also impact the yields of the underlying \nasset and thus the price. \nGiven that the underlying fixed income instruments are \nlisted in global markets they are more sensitive to macro-\neconomic factors and global macro environment thus having \neffects beyond the issuer specific.\nA thorough analysis of the risk rating (and changes to \nratings) of the constituent underlying assets will be carried \nand each investment is independently undertaken. Further \nto risk rating analysis of corporate bonds, a comprehensive \nfinancial analysis of the company to determine its liquidity \nmargins and cash flow yields is done. \nCash and cash equivalents are employed as control tools \nbetween trades, ensuring efficient portfolio management. \nLimits are set on the aggregate book value of investments in \na single bond or security, as well as the holding of corporate \nbonds or commercial papers related to any single issuer, \nwith compliance monitored based on the most up-to-date \nfund value.\nIt may be difficult for a fund to liquidate an redeem its \nunderlying assets in a short notice during extreme market \nconditions without suffering a loss.  \nInvesting may lead to payment of additional fees and \nexpenses in relation to the fund executing it trades. \nWHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN\nThe numbers rate how the fund will behave and how much \nrisk there is to your invested capital. Generally, in markets \nthe chance to make large gains means a risk of suffering \nhigher losses. \nRisk category 1:\nA category 1 fund is not a risk-free investment. It means the \nrisk of losing your invested capital is small, but also the risk \nof making gains is small.  \nRisk category 7:\nIn a category 7 fund, the potential for huge returns is high \nbut also the risk of losing your money is also high. \nNote: The seven-category risk scale (The Synthetic Risk and \nReward Indicator, SRRI, series) is a complex undertaking \nand a scale category of 2 does not imply that it is twice as \nrisky as category 1 risk. \t\nAdditional risks to the fund have been outlined in the \nsupplementary information memorandum of the fund \nin addition to the risks outlined in the Arvocap Unit Trust \nScheme Information Memorandum.\nLower Risk\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nTypically lower rewards\nHigher Risk\nTypically higher rewards\nManaged by Arvocap Asset Managers Limited\nKEY INVESTOR\nINFORMATION DOCUMENT\nArvocap Eurofix Fixed Income Special Fund\nRegulated by The Capital Markets Authority\nT: +254 701 300 200  /  E: invest@arvocap.com  //  www.arvocap.com",

It is mandated by regulations to facilitate your comprehension \nof the fund’s characteristics and associated risks. We strongly recommend reviewing it to enable an informed investment decision.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe investment objective of the Arvocap Multi-Asset Strategy \nSpecial Fund (USD) is to attain risk-adjusted returns surpassing the \nmarket average by investing in various asset classes traded across \nglobal capital markets. Additionally, it seeks to actively monitor \nmajor global themes to enable investors to capitalize on global asset \nprice volatility, while maintaining a macro perspective on events to \nachieve capital growth and risk management. The objective is to \nachieve an absolute return with low correlation to traditional asset \nclasses, utilizing an active asset allocation strategy across different \nasset classes.\nINVESTMENT POLICY\nThe fund investment strategy involves capital allocation in a \ndiverse range of assets in the global market place to achieve a \nrich diversified portfolio. The fund captures market movements \ntriggered by prevailing global macro-economic themes. It achieves \nthis through a careful analysis of emerging themes, their intended \nimpact, the risks they will cause and the nature and magnitude of \nimpact on global market place. A risk diversified allocation strategy \nis then implemented to achieve portfolio optimization. \nThe fund utilizes short-medium-long term strategy based on the \nanalysed and documented evolution of the underlying theme that \nforms the cornerstone of the investment thesis. The fund does not \nengage in speculative behavior nor enter into short-term trades \nwith the aim of speculating. Every trade is carefully analyzed and \nimplemented in the context of a larger theme. \nWHY THE FUND IS CATEGORY 7?\nThe fund is rated category 7 due to its exposure to different asset \nclasses whose risk characters differ greatly. The factors below have \nan impact on the value of investments and expose the fund to \npotential losses.  \nDue to the low correlation of the asset classes in the fund, the \nfund has potential to achieve high degrees of risk and return \ndiversification.\nSome of the assets in the fund such as CFDs and other derivative \nproducts are leveraged or trading with margins. Even with \ndiversification and risk control measures such as stop losses, \nextreme market movement may lead to several stop loss triggers \nthus affecting performance of the fund. \nSome of the underlying assets such as currencies have high \nvolatilities which may increase the volatility of the overall fund. \nIt may be difficult for a fund to liquidate an redeem its underlying \nassets in a short notice during extreme market conditions without \nsuffering a loss.  \nThrough a risk-adjusted allocation strategy the fund gives investors \nan opportunity to deploy capital and participate in global themes \nsuch as commodity booms (agricultural, industrial metals, energy, \nprecious metals, minerals), interest rates evolutions, strategic \nindustrial sector evolutions (semi-conductor booms), emerging \nmarket opportunities (crypto) and global trade dynamics (currency).\nRestrictions are imposed on the aggregate book value of investments \nin a single asset class, with additional limits on holdings related \nto any single issuer and crypto assets, ensuring prudent portfolio \ndiversification and risk management. Compliance with these limits \nand restrictions is monitored based on the most up-to-date value of \nthe Arvocap Multi-Asset Strategy Special Fund (USD).\nUnit Holders receive monthly reports in the form of fact sheets, \nproviding detailed insights into investment activity, performance, \nand any changes within the portfolio. Additionally, all units in \nthe fund offer an income accumulation option where applicable, \nallowing income generated from underlying investments to accrue \nto unit holders in the form of new units. The fund benchmarks its \nperformance against the Bloomberg Global Multi-Asset Index, \naligning its investment objectives with global multi-asset market \nperformance.\nYou can sell your shares any day (except Saturday or Sunday) that \nbanks are open in Nairobi, Kenya.\nRecommendation: The Fund is suitable for investors with a time \nhorizon of 5 years and above.\nThe fund invests in different global markets and the global currency \nfluctuations may have an impact on the fund.  \nInvesting may lead to payment of additional fees and expenses in \nrelation to the fund executing it trades. \nWHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN\nThe numbers rate how the fund will behave and how much risk \nthere is to your invested capital.

Market Risk:  Pertains to the possibility of facing financial losses due to fluctuations in \nfinancial markets.

Financial Risk: Financial risk encompasses a broad range of risks related to financial \ninstruments, market conditions, or operational factors that may affect the fund's \nfinancial stability. Mitigation strategies include robust risk management practices, stress \ntesting, and maintaining adequate capital buffers to withstand adverse financial event \n16.4. Interest Risk: Interest rate risk signifies the effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the \nvalue of fixed-income securities.

Credit Risk: Credit rating risk pertains to the potential for investment losses stemming \nfrom alterations in the credit ratings of securities within the portfolio.

Inflation Risk: Inflation risk arises from the erosion of purchasing power due to rising \ninflation, which can potentially diminish investment returns.

Seniority Risk: In the context of structured debt instruments, seniority risk arises from \nthe potential for lower priority in receiving repayments if a default or liquidation occurs. \nTo mitigate this risk, comprehensive due diligence on the seniority structure of debt \ninstruments, diversification across different debt securities, and careful evaluation of \nthe credit quality and ranking of different debt tranches are essential strategies to \nminimize potential losses in case of default or restructuring.",

Liquidity Risk: Relates to the Fund’s inability to meet its short-term financial obligations. \nIt stems from investments in valuable assets that cannot easily be traded at market \nvalue. The Fund Manager shall periodically undertake liquidity gap analysis and other \nliquidity stress tests to ensure availability of sufficient liquidity as anticipated. \n17.2. Market Risk:  Pertains to the possibility of facing financial losses due to fluctuations in \nfinancial markets. To address this risk, the fund can minimize exposure by spreading its \ninvestments across different types of assets, utilizing hedging techniques, and \nperforming comprehensive market analysis to predict and respond to evolving market \ndynamics. \n17.3. Financial Risk: Financial risk encompasses a broad range of risks related to financial \ninstruments, market conditions, or operational factors that may affect the fund's \nfinancial stability. Mitigation strategies include robust risk management practices, stress \ntesting, and maintaining adequate capital buffers to withstand adverse financial event. \n17.4. Currency Risk: Currency risk represent the potential negative influence on investments \ncaused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These risks materialize when an\n\nSupplemental Information Memorandum – Arvocap Global Sharia Equity Special Fund (USD) \n10 \ninvestment is in a currency different from the investor's base currency, leading to shifts \nin the investment's worth as exchange rates change. To counter currency and exchange \nrate risks, employing hedging strategies such as currency forward contracts or options \nserves as a safeguard against unfavorable currency movements. Furthermore, spreading \ninvestments across various currencies or regions helps diminish exposure to the volatility \nof a single currency. Continuous monitoring of global economic and geopolitical factors, \ncoupled with in-depth analysis of currency trends, facilitates well-informed decisions to \nmitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the investment portfolio. \nAdditionally, maintaining a balanced and diversified portfolio across different currencies \nfurther minimizes the overall risk associated with currency fluctuations.",

Continuous monitoring of global economic and geopolitical factors, \ncoupled with in-depth analysis of currency trends, facilitates well-informed decisions to \nmitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the investment portfolio. \nAdditionally, maintaining a balanced and diversified portfolio across different currencies \nfurther minimizes the overall risk associated with currency fluctuations.\n\nSupplemental Information Memorandum – Arvocap Africa Equity Special Fund \n8",

The Fund Manager shall periodically undertake liquidity gap analysis and other \nliquidity stress tests to ensure availability of sufficient liquidity as anticipated. \n16.3. Market Risk:  Pertains to the possibility of facing financial losses due to fluctuations in \nfinancial markets.

Financial Risk: Financial risk encompasses a broad range of risks related to financial \ninstruments, market conditions, or operational factors that may affect the fund's \nfinancial stability.

These risks materialize when an \ninvestment is in a currency different from the investor's base currency, leading to shifts \nin the investment's worth as exchange rates change. To counter currency and exchange \nrate risks, employing hedging strategies such as currency forward contracts or options \nserves as a safeguard against unfavorable currency movements. Furthermore, spreading \ninvestments across various currencies or regions helps diminish exposure to the volatility \nof a single currency. Continuous monitoring of global economic and geopolitical factors, \ncoupled with in-depth analysis of currency trends, facilitates well-informed decisions to \nmitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the investment portfolio. \nAdditionally, maintaining a balanced and diversified portfolio across different currencies \nfurther minimizes the overall risk associated with currency fluctuations. \n16.6.

Strategies \nto alleviate this risk involve sustaining compliance teams, conducting routine legal \nevaluations, and proactively interacting with regulatory entities to remain informed \nabout modifications and adjust the fund's practices accordingly.",

RISK INFORMATION \nIn addition to the risks highlighted on the Information Memorandum Clause 7, below risks are inherent to \nthis fund: \n16.1. Liquidity Risk: Relates to the Fund’s inability to meet its short-term financial obligations. \nIt stems from investments in valuable assets that cannot easily be traded at market \nvalue. The Fund Manager shall periodically undertake liquidity gap analysis and other \nliquidity stress tests to ensure availability of sufficient liquidity as anticipated. \n16.2. Market Risk:  Pertains to the possibility of facing financial losses due to fluctuations in \nfinancial markets. To address this risk, the fund can minimize exposure by spreading its \ninvestments across different types of assets, utilizing hedging techniques, and \nperforming comprehensive market analysis to predict and respond to evolving market \ndynamics. \n16.3. Financial Risk: Financial risk encompasses a broad range of risks related to financial \ninstruments, market conditions, or operational factors that may affect the fund's \nfinancial stability. Mitigation strategies include robust risk management practices, stress \ntesting, and maintaining adequate capital buffers to withstand adverse financial event \n16.4. Interest Risk: Interest rate risk signifies the effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the \nvalue of fixed-income securities. To alleviate this risk, strategies include diversifying the \nduration of fixed-income holdings, employing interest rate derivatives, and consistently \nevaluating and adjusting the portfolio's sensitivity to interest rate changes\n\nSupplemental Information Memorandum – Arvocap Eurofix Fixed Income Special Fund (USD) \n8 \n16.5. Credit Risk: Credit rating risk pertains to the potential for investment losses stemming \nfrom alterations in the credit ratings of securities within the portfolio. To address this \nrisk, diversifying across various credit qualities, conducting ongoing credit monitoring,  \nand performing thorough credit analysis can mitigate the effects of changes in credit \nratings \n16.6. Inflation Risk: Inflation risk arises from the erosion of purchasing power due to rising \ninflation, which can potentially diminish investment returns. Strategies to mitigate \ninflation risk include investing in asset classes that have historically outpaced inflation, \nsuch as real estate or commodities, and employing inflation-hedging instruments like \nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). \n16.7. Seniority Risk: In the context of structured debt instruments, seniority risk arises from \nthe potential for lower priority in receiving repayments if a default or liquidation occurs. \nTo mitigate this risk, comprehensive due diligence on the seniority structure of debt \ninstruments, diversification across different debt securities, and careful evaluation of \nthe credit quality and ranking of different debt tranches are essential strategies to \nminimize potential losses in case of default or restructuring. \n16.8. Currency Risk: Currency risk represent the potential negative influence on investments \ncaused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These risks materialize when an \ninvestment is in a currency different from the investor's base currency, leading to shifts \nin the investment's worth as exchange rates change. To counter currency and exchange \nrate risks, employing hedging strategies such as currency forward contracts or options \nserves as a safeguard against unfavorable currency movements. Furthermore, spreading \ninvestments across various currencies or regions helps diminish exposure to the volatility \nof a single currency. Continuous monitoring of global economic and geopolitical factors, \ncoupled with in-depth analysis of currency trends, facilitates well-informed decisions to \nmitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the investment portfolio. \nAdditionally, maintaining a balanced and diversified portfolio across different currencies \nfurther minimizes the overall risk associated with currency fluctuations.",

Liquidity Risk: Relates to the Fund’s inability to meet its short-term financial obligations. \nIt stems from investments in valuable assets that cannot easily be traded at market \nvalue. The Fund Manager shall periodically undertake liquidity gap analysis and other \nliquidity stress tests to ensure availability of sufficient liquidity as anticipated. \n16.3.

Furthermore, spreading \ninvestments across various currencies or regions helps diminish exposure to the volatility \nof a single currency. Continuous monitoring of global economic and geopolitical factors, \ncoupled with in-depth analysis of currency trends, facilitates well-informed decisions to \nmitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the investment portfolio. \nAdditionally, maintaining a balanced and diversified portfolio across different currencies \nfurther minimizes the overall risk associated with currency fluctuations.",
