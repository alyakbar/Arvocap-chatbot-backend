The factors below have an impact on the value of investments and expose the fund to potential losses. The income derived from the underlying asset may fall when there is late payments or defaults by the issuer. The average weighted life of the assets held in the fund is less than 18 months, this reduces tenure risk for the portfolio. The short-life of the assets held means that most will be held to maturity thus reducing price volatility risks due to trading.

Generally, in markets the chance to make large gains means a risk of suffering higher losses. Risk category 1: A category 1 fund is not a risk-free investment. It means the risk of losing your invested capital is small, but also the risk of making gains is small. Risk category 7: In a category 7 fund, the potential for huge returns is high but also the risk of losing your money is also high. Note: The seven-category risk scale (The Synthetic Risk and Reward Indicator, SRRI, series) is a complex undertaking and a scale category of 2 does not imply that it is twice as risky as category 1 risk.

INVESTMENT POLICY The funds investment strategy entails actively managing asset allocation within an equity portfolio of high-quality Africa businesses listed in various exchanges across Africa. The nature of the underlying business for a company to qualify, even when its cross-listed or listed outside Africa is that a huge portion of its revenue is derived in Africa. A key consideration for the portfolio assets is the shape of their balance sheets, with the fund allocating capital only to businesses that maintain strong balance sheets.

The price of the underlying asset may rise or fall under the impact or yields, or demand and supply dynamics leading to variance and potential capital loss during normal trading or liquidation. Changes in an issuers risk categorization by rating agencies can also impact the yields of the underlying asset and thus the price. Given that the underlying fixed income instruments are listed in global markets they are more sensitive to macro- economic factors and global macro environment thus having effects beyond the issuer specific. A thorough analysis of the risk rating (and changes to ratings) of the constituent underlying assets will be carried and each investment is independently undertaken. Further to risk rating analysis of corporate bonds, a comprehensive financial analysis of the company to determine its liquidity margins and cash flow yields is done. Cash and cash equivalents are employed as control tools between trades, ensuring efficient portfolio management.",
